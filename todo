TODO:

- Try to understand JWT, I understand it, but I'm not too sure how to store JWT securely in browser.
    For now, I'm just going to get it working using localStorage
    Then later, I can make it secure
- User can logout X
- Rooms redirects to Home if not logged in X
    Also displays error when user is not logged in.
- Should my errors property in store be an array? It's confusing me
    I decided to have an array of errors, because what if there are more than one errors?
- Log in page not redirecting to /rooms page X
    I'm going to redirect by passing in history into dispatch actions
    It seems a lot more simpler that way
    I don't think I need processing_auth anymore then. 
- Need a register page. X Register page complete, creates user and signs in on success
- Change error json in authenticate to be errors.full_messages X Json now properly formatted to return array of messages
- Error component should not display duplicate errors X Changed reducer, so it overrides old messages.
- Now display rooms real time X => displays real time using WS
    Need to create subscription
    Okay I have subscription and channel created
    Create create and delete actions for rooms
    Need to update store with data from rebroadcast 
    X /rooms displays rooms real time w connection to WS
- Creating a Room using WebSockets X => can now create a room using WebSockets!!
- Rooms should have max capacity of eight X Will manage using client
- Should be redirected to login, if login fails from home X redirects to login if credentials can't login in set_login
- Change processing_auth state property to processingAuth X => changed
- Unsubscribe when unmount to /rooms component? X => unsubscribes when Room component unmounts
- Join a Room and begin chatting X => Can join/leave room and chat real time
- Remove wsSubscribed, instead use state.room to check if subscribed to room
    -> make sure to make state.room = undefined when unsubscribed
    -> same goes for RoomsList subscribing
    X => Room component handles subscriptions

? User validations
? REGEX expression for handleAuthRedirect for /rooms url
? Sign in via Google drive?
