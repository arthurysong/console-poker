TODO:

- Try to understand JWT, I understand it, but I'm not too sure how to store JWT securely in browser.
    For now, I'm just going to get it working using localStorage
    Then later, I can make it secure
- User can logout X
- Rooms redirects to Home if not logged in X
    Also displays error when user is not logged in.
- Should my errors property in store be an array? It's confusing me
    I decided to have an array of errors, because what if there are more than one errors?
- Log in page not redirecting to /rooms page X
    I'm going to redirect by passing in history into dispatch actions
    It seems a lot more simpler that way
    I don't think I need processing_auth anymore then. 
- Need a register page. X Register page complete, creates user and signs in on success
- Sign in via Google drive?
- User validations
- Change error json in authenticate to be errors.full_messages X Json now properly formatted to return array of messages
- Error component should not display duplicate errors X Changed reducer, so it overrides old messages.
- Now display rooms real time
- Rooms should have max capacity of eight
