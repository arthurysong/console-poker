=====

When game starts, everyone in room subscribes to game channel
It grabs the new round, and broadcasts that out to everyone
How can I keep track of the status? Do I just keep track of that in round.status?
After every successful move, I rebroadcast the round? I have to rebroadcast the whole round because many things different things can change.


State has round info:
active_players,
community_cards,
pot,
raise
and status?
